# BonemealControl
Minecraft modification for controlling which items bonemeal can be used on.

Enable or disable vanilla bonemeal:
 - Saplings
 - Farmland plants (wheat, carrots, potatoes, beetroot)
 - Grass blocks
 - Tall grass and flowers
 - Mushrooms
 - Cocoa pods

Enable bonemeal for:
 - Cactus
 - Sugarcane
 - Melons and pumpkins
 - Vines

 - Chorus Flowers
 
Add custom bonemeal recipes.  You can specify:
 - Target block to replace
 - Type of block to replace it with
 - Radius of bonemeal effect in number of blocks
 - Chance of block being replaced
 - Place items on the surface rather than replace the target block (e.g. for creating saplings on dirt)
 
See the wiki for more details.
