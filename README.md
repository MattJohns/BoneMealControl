# BoneMealControl
Minecraft modification for controlling which items bone meal can be used on.

Enable or disable vanilla bone meal:
 - Farmland plants (wheat, carrots, potatoes, beetroot)
 - Saplings
 - Grass blocks
 - Tall grass and flowers
 - Mushrooms
 - Cocoa pods

Enable bone meal for:
 - Cactus
 - Sugarcane
 - Melons and pumpkins
 - Vines
 - Nether Wart
 - Chorus Flowers
 - Zombies
 - Animals
 
Add custom bone meal recipes.  You can specify:
 - Target block to replace
 - Type of block to replace it with
 - Block state for target and fill blocks (See [wiki](https://github.com/MattJohns/BoneMealControl/wiki) for format)
 - Radius of bone meal effect
 - Chance of block being replaced
 - Place items on the surface rather than replace the target block (e.g. for creating saplings on dirt)
 
See the [wiki](https://github.com/MattJohns/BoneMealControl/wiki) for more details.
